        <p>In the city that never sleeps, multiple cultures travel through the busy streets of New York. As the subway train roars beneath the metropolis, I often feel like a tiny ant among the overwhelmingly large city. It’s easy to feel submerged, to feel like a complete stranger among the crowd, and easy to wonder if you belong in this massive city. This is my view of New York, a city that can be both captivating and intimidating.
          Every New Yorker, at some point, has personally experienced the immensity of the city. The towering skyscrapers, the never-ending seams of people, and the countless amount of languages spoken on the streets, they all form part of the chaos that defines New York. On these days where the city feels larger than life, it's inevitable to feel invisible through all the commotion.
          The subway system, with its maze-like tunnels and fast pace, is a symbol of the city’s chaos. The train’s relentless noise and constant announcements create a sense of isolation, reminding me that I'm just a lonely passenger on the city’s never-ending journey.
          Among the chaos, the heart of New York runs on its neighborhoods, each offering a unique view of cultures. In such neighborhoods exists Corona, in Queens, where I find refuge in the chaos. In the vibrant, welcoming neighborhood, I found a place where I felt safe, embraced and welcomed.
          The heart of the Corona neighborhood is 103rd Street Corona Plaza, which is the neighborhood plaza where everything and everyones comes together. The plaza becomes alive with the sounds of children screaming and playing, food vendor's hustling trying to get you to buy their mouth watering delicacies, and people coming together to celebrate their culture. The scenery is filled with the vibrant green, white and red of the Mexican flags that hang overhead, the smell of tacos and tamales, and the familiar Spanish phrases that take me to the heart of my culture.
          In the heart of the neighborhood I can taste the rich heritage of Mexican cuisine, taking in each bite as if it were my abuelita’s recipe that has been passed down in my family. It’s a place where I’ve experienced the power of cultural connection, a place where my identity is nurtured and celebrated.
          The heart of the neighborhood is living proof of the powerful emotional connections one can make with such a place. As the 7 train announces, “This is 103rd Street Corona Plaza,” it’s a comforting reminder that even in the most intimidating New York, there are places that offer solace and belonging. This announcement signifies a return to home, a place where I can celebrate my roots, culture and identity.
          In the heart of the neighborhood I learned that the places we have emotional connections to allow us to fully embrace our culture and identity. In the heart of the neighborhood, the proud traditions of Mexican culture are on full display, offering a home away from home.
          Because many people feel safe on 103rd Street, the plaza is a melting pot of traditions and allows our culture to thrive. Because the heart of the neighborhood makes people feel welcomed, the local shops and vendors share their family’s receta. Because the heart of the neighborhood makes people feel embraced, we listen to mariachis, cumbias, sonideras, huapangos, nortenas, banda, corridos and feel free to dance. Because the heart of the neighborhood makes us feel connected, we share the common legends of La Llorona, La Chupacabra, and made up experiences our tios swear they’ve lived. Because the heart of the neighborhood makes people feel proud, we celebrate 16 de Septiembre as if we were in the zocalo in Mexico City. Because of the heart of the neighborhood, we are free to embrace our culture and identity, creating a sense of community that cuts across cultural barriers.
          In the end, it’s not the chaos of the city that defines us; it’s the places that make us feel at home, connected, and proud of our cultural roots. These places allow us to fully embrace our culture and identity, offering a sense of belonging in a city where everyone is a New Yorker, but each New Yorker’s story is unique.
